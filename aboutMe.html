        <h1>About POINT - Samir</h1>
        <p>POINT is created and owned by 19 year old, Samir Baig. Ever since a young age, i've been interested in video games, like most kids. My first ever gaming console being the SNES also known as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Since that console, i've been playing video games that have span across several generations from Gamecube, to DS, to Wii, to PS2, to PS3 and lastly at the modern generation of PS4/Nintendo switch. Never owned an XBOX of any kind. I've always been interested in multiple types of video games, all different genres; Racing, FPS, Platformers, Fighting, Arcade, Action-Adventure, Party games, the list goes on.</p>
